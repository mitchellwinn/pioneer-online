# RPG Entities Plugin

Shared Entity / NPC / Player character systems for RPG-style games.

## Features

- Base `Entity` script for common RPG character behavior
- `NPC` and `PlayerCharacter` implementations
- Movement, navigation, animation, and stamina handling
- `WarpZone` Area3D for same-scene warps (optionally wrapped in SceneTransitions)

## Installation

1. Copy `rpg_entities` to your project's `addons/` folder
2. Enable **RPG Entities** in **Project → Project Settings → Plugins**

## Usage

- Use the provided prefabs and scripts as the base for your RPG characters
- Integrates with other gsg plugins (Dialogue Manager, Scene Transitions, etc.) as used in the YGBF project

## License

These plugins are provided as-is and can be used freely. There is a strong priority for modularity, but ultimately all gsg plugins are designed with one another in mind and meant first and foremost for in-house development endeavors.
